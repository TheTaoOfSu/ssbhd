# ssbhd

ssbhd aims to provide a [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz) server across desktop OSs and on mobile as purely in Haskell as possible. Although most mobile users likely don't need just a server, establishing this from the beginning will pave the way for a full user client in the future.

It will use the [Obelisk](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk) platform leveraging [Reflex FRP](https://reflex-frp.org).
